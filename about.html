            <p>There are <b>800 million players worldwide</b> who play volleyball at least once a week. Volleyball is a safe, fun and enjoyable sport that does not require extreme fitness. As such, itâ€™s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit without pushing them to their limit. The sport also adheres to the more competitive people as well because games can be highly exhilarating and intense. Beach volleyball is suitable for people of <b>all ages, men and women alike.</b> Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should consult their doctor before participating.</p>

            <p>Volleyball is a <b>team orientated</b> sport played by two opposing teams on a playing court divided in the middle by a net.
The sport originated in the United States, and is now just achieving the type of popularity in the U.S. that it has received on a global basis, where it ranks behind only soccer among participation sports. <br><br>
                <b>The objective </b>of the game is for each team to <b>move the ball regularly</b> over the net to ground it on the opponent's court, all while preventing the ball from being grounded on theirs. The ball is put into play by the right back-row player who serves the ball by hitting it over the net to the opponent's court.<b>A team is allowed to hit the ball three times</b> (in addition to the block contact) to return it to the opponent's court. A player is not allowed to hit the ball twice consecutively, except when attempting a block. The rally continues until the ball touches the ground/floor, goes "out" or a team fails to return it to the opponent's court or commits a fault.<br><br>

The team who wins a rally, scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise.
The best of three or best of five games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap).
